# Power Amplifier
It is a device/circuit that amplifies the power of the input signal to drive the output devices like speakers,headphones. 
Used for radars,,guidance,radio communication, Electronic warfare systems and many more RF applications.
Critical parameters are : linearity, Output power for reliable communication systems.
There are so many types of amplifiers which are classified on the basis of topology of the switching transistor connection. Also on the way in which their power output stages are configured and operated. 

**Main Operating characteristics of ideal amplifier are:**
a. Linearity
b. Signal Gain
c. Efficiency
d. Power output        
**In real world Amplifiers always there is a tradeoff between these characteristics**

Some of these are Class A,B,AB,C,D,E,F,G,S,T and many more. 
These classes are developed to optimize the crucial parameters of power amplifier which alter the performance of the amplifier.

**Class A,B,AB,C**-- These are types of amplifiers which are used in analog circuits where efficiency can be not so important factor.
**Class D E F G S T**-- These are used mostly in digital circuits where switching activity is faster.

Here in this paper they have designed the amplifier in Cadence AWR environment with Wolfspeedâ€™s CGH40010F transistor which is available in the AWR suite.
**CGH40010F**-- C--Cree| G-GaN substrate| H- HEMT technology| 400- upper frequency of 400GHz| 10- 10 Watts of max power| F- Package Type
